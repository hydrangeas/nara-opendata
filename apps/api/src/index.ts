// TODO: This is a placeholder file for initial setup (issue #14)
// This file will be replaced with actual implementation in subsequent issues

// NOTE: Production server logic has been temporarily removed as part of the

// including authentication, rate limiting, and data endpoints will be
// added in the following issues:
// - Authentication setup
// - API endpoint implementation
// - Database integration
// - etc.
